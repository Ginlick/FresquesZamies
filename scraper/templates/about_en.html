<p>
    One Planet Friends is a collective promoting greater awareness about environmental issues, mainly by encouraging collective intelligence workshops.
</p>
<h1 class="eventsTable">Organization of workshops</h1>
<p>We organize in-person workshops to help raise in the general public the awareness, knowledge and understanding of the various limits affecting life on this planet.</p>
<p>We organize:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Local partnerships to secure rooms where the workshops can be offered to the general public.</li>
    <li>Providing these rooms to volunteer facilitators.</li>
    <li>A ticketing system to serve as a landing page and manage signups.</li>
    <li>Publication on various calendars including this Web site.</li>
    <li>Where agreed upon, reimbursement of train tickets for facilitators we mobilized from further away.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We encourage the facilitators of workshops that do not appear in our calendar, to contact us.
</p>
<p>The facilitators commit to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="mailto:info@oneplanetfriends.org">Get in touch with a representative of One Planet Friends</a> early enough to organize and publicize the workshop.</li>
    <li>Inform One Planet Friends of any particular conditions mandated by the corresponding association, if any.</li>
    <li>Help promote the workshop by any judicious means to make it visible and encourage signups.</li>
    <li>Be ready to cancel the workshop if there are less than 4 participants a couple of days prior.</li>
    <li>Respect the requirements of the room being provided for the workshop.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="eventsTable">Promotion of workshops</h1>
<p>We publish this page, which collects all (or most of the) workshops scheduled soon in person in Switzerland, independently of who organizes them.</p>

<h2>How does this site work?</h2>
<p>The calendar collects events from the ticketing platforms used by various workshops to combine them and make them more accessible. That said, our site:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Is not an official tool. Click on a workshop sends to the corresponding ticketing platform.
    </li>
    <li>
        Is not exhaustive. The calendars being read correspond to the following workshops: {{calendarList}}. If you are aware of other in-person workshops happening in Switzerland, please send us a link to the site or the corresponding ticketing platform.
    </li>
    <li>
        Does not run in real time. There can be a delay of multiple days for an event appearing on a ticketing platform to be reflected here.
    </li>
    <li>
        Is not perfect. Some events may not appear for various technical reasons, for example the city not being mentioned in the address. Please send us a link to the event and we'll see what we can do.
    </li>
    <li>
        Does not replace a manual search, notably when we list no available workshops.
    </li>
</ul>
